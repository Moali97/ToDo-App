# ToDo-App
<!-- how user can get strated with project  -->
<!-- what project does  -->
This is a classic todo app where I was able to learn the fundamentals of Django, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap and used postgreSQL for the database of this app.  
<!-- Why its useful  -->
I created this app becuase it was a good starting point in my web development journey and I wanted to have something to set reminders and this app was great for this. 

<!-- what i will add in the future  -->
Some features that I would like to add to this project in the future include a reminder button where the app will notify me to finish a task at a later time.
